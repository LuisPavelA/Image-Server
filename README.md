# Image Server
### Made by Luis Pavel

## Description
With this server you can upload, delete, view, download your images!

It has two themes, dark mode and light mode.

Only the person with the token will be able to upload or delete the images.

The tokens are encrypted and are stored in the Environment Variables.

This is my submission for the #MadeWithReplit hackathon! I hope you like it!

## Self Hosting

I do not recommend running this for actually storing images as it is not that good and might have a few bugs as I only made it in a few days.
